# **DOOM-ML-MapGen**
*Note : This is a third year project part of my work at Goldsmiths, University of London.*

This is a machine learning map generation program built with Python. This project utilises **Tensorflow **+** Keras** and **OpenCV**.

You can take any DOOM map marker image and process it through a machine learning model and it will try and build a DOOM map from it. This is a work in progress so the model is not perfect and results can vary wildly.
